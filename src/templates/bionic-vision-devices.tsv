Amazing Vision has added a tiny solar panel to the chip that generates power by absorbing infrared light. This improvement reduces inflammation to the eye, reduces infection risk, and gives clearer and wider vision to the patient it was implanted in. Animal tests have already been conducted and have proven useful. Human testing was delayed due to the pandemic, but is soon to be conducted.

This data is processed by a portable unit and transmitted wirelessly to an electrode array in the eye, stimulating the retina's remaining cells to send visual information to the brain.

Approved by the FDA in 2013 and previously granted the CE Mark in 2011 in Europe, the Argus II was the first retinal implant to receive these certifications, allowing users to perform basic visual tasks.
